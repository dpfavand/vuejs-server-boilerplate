# Overview
This repo is a starting point for building a vuejs frontend and node backend in the same repository. This allows the convenience of packaging up the whole repository for deployment to an AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk. Probably not great for bigger projects where you really need to keep the backend and frontend separate, but so far works well enough for smaller projects
# Build
All scripts are defined in package.json. No gulp.
## Production
Start the server with `npm start` - this will build the frontend and start the server
## Development
Running `npm run dev` will start a hot-reloading build for vue.js that will automatically reload modules as they're saved
## Task descriptions
### build
    "browserify app/app.js -g envify -t vueify -p [ vueify/plugins/extract-css -o public/styles.bundle.css ] -t babelify -o public/app.bundle.js",
The production builder - the `vueify/plugins/extract-css` browserify plugin wraps all of the css down to one file to prevent screen flash

    "watch": "watchify app/app.js -t vueify -t babelify -p browserify-hmr -o public/app.bundle.js",
The development builder - uses `watchify` and `browserify-hmr` to rebuild and hot-reload modules during development

    "start": "node server.js",
The script that actually starts the server in production - called by `npm start`

    "prestart": "npm run build"
The script that initiates the front-end build in production - called by `npm start`
    
    "dev": "concurrently \"nodemon server.js\" \"npm run watch\""
Call this to start the server and frontend watcher for development
